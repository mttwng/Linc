## Project Description

Linc exchanges social information with your partner when you shake hands. You can have different profiles set up for different kind of events, i.e. LinkedIn for career fair and Facebook for blind date. By minimizing interactions with our smartphones during the critical first moments of meeting someone, we put the power back into relationship dynamics and take technology to the background.
