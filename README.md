## Project Description

Linc exchanges social information with your partner when you shake hands, bump fists, or do any one of our commonly used friendly gestures. You can have different profiles set up for different kind of gestures, i.e. LinkedIn for handshake and Facebook for fist-bump. By minimizing interactions with our smartphones during the critical first moments of meeting someone, we put the power back into relationship dynamics and take technology to the background.
